# MealMatch – Bitcamp 2026

A full-stack web platform that connects restaurants with surplus food to nearby communities, reducing food waste and improving same-day food access.

---

## Overview

MealMatch has four distinct user roles, each with a tailored interface:

| Role | What they do |
|------|-------------|
| **Restaurant** | Post surplus food listings with pickup windows, dietary tags, and geocoded addresses |
| **Recipient** | Browse active listings, claim food, track pickups on a live map |
| **Partner** | Bulk-claim up to 50 items per listing for shelters, pantries, or community orgs |
| **Admin** | Moderate all listings, view platform stats, inspect login audit logs |

---

## Features

### Authentication
- JWT-based auth (24-hour tokens, bcrypt password hashing)
- Role-aware signup: recipients must verify an EBT card number + PIN at registration
- EBT verification is re-checked on every login for recipient accounts
- Login audit log visible to admins (last 250 attempts)

### Food Listings (Restaurant)
- Post food with title, description, quantity, dietary tags, address, and pickup window
- Address autocomplete with lat/lng geocoding; previously used addresses are saved per session
- Optional pickup slots (labeled 10–15 minute windows with per-slot capacity)
- Optional partner-priority window: locks a listing to partners/admins for N minutes before general availability
- View own active, claimed, and expired listings with live status
- Demand prediction endpoint per listing (restaurant + admin)

### Browse Feed (Recipient)
- Live feed of active listings sorted by pickup deadline
- Smart match score: listings are ranked by proximity, dietary preferences, and urgency
- Filter by dietary tag (vegetarian, vegan, halal, gluten-free, etc.)
- Countdown timers with urgent warnings (< 30 minutes remaining)
- Claim 1–10 items; slot selection required when a listing has pickup slots
- Cancel claims from the My Claims page — restores quantity and revives the listing to active

### Interactive Map
- Leaflet-based map pinning all active listings by geocoordinates
- Turn-by-turn navigation with driving / walking / cycling / transit modes
- Real-time distance and ETA tracking using Haversine fallback when GPS is unavailable
- Map errors reported back to backend for remote diagnostics

### Partner Portal
- Bulk-claim up to 50 items in one request
- Group name and contact info fields for coordinated community pickup logistics
- First-claim lock: each partner can claim each listing once

### Admin Dashboard
- Platform stats: active / claimed / expired listing counts, total claims, meals saved
- Full listings table across all statuses with status override and delete controls
- Login archive: last 250 login attempts with success/failure, role, EBT info
- Map error log: client-side map crashes forwarded to backend for inspection

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 19 + Vite
- React Router v6 (role-gated routes)
- Leaflet / react-leaflet for maps
- Custom `mm-*` CSS design system (CSS variables, dark theme, mobile-responsive)
- Vitest + Testing Library for unit tests
- ESLint with react-hooks and react-refresh rules

### Backend
- Python 3.13 + FastAPI
- PyJWT + bcrypt for auth
- SQLite for user persistence (`mealmatch_users.db`) and listing/claim persistence (`mealmatch_listings.db`)
- In-memory dicts as the hot-path store; SQLite as the write-through side-channel
- pytest + FastAPI TestClient for integration tests (isolated temp DB per test run)
- Uvicorn server

## Demo Accounts

These accounts are seeded at startup and always available:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `admin@mealmatch.dev` | `Admin1234!` | Admin |
| `restaurant@mealmatch.dev` | `Restaurant1!` | Restaurant |
| `recipient@mealmatch.dev` | `Recipient1!` | Recipient (EBT pre-verified) |
| `partner@mealmatch.dev` | `Partner1234!` | Partner |

1,000 demo listings are seeded across major U.S. metros and refreshed on every server restart so pickup windows are never stale.
